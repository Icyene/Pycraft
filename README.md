Pycraft
=======

A partial Python Minecraft client implementation.

I've attempted to keep things as true to the vanilla Minecraft as possible, but some things were not possible due to the nature of Python.

* Chunks are 8x8 rather than 16x16 to speed up both chunk generation and rendering.
* Currently operates at 40 ticks/second

Usage
-----

To run, simply run `python __init__.py` or double-click `__init__.py`, if you have Python associated with the `.py` extension.

Enjoy!
